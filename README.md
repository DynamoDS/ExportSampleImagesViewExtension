 Export Sample Images for Dynamo

ExportSampleImages (ESI) is a View Extension for Dynamo which allows you to create images from Dyanmo graphs. The resulting image is a combination of the graph workspace combined with the geometry output view. The workspace will be 'cleaned-up' before the export resulting in a nice and tidy looking images. 
The extension supports multiple graphs and sports a basic, although informative UI showing the names of the Graphs to be exported, the progress and final result. You can refer to the images below for a brief introduction to ESI.
